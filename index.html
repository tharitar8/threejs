              <p> Hey! Thank you for stopping by.
              </p>
              <p>
              My Name is Tharitar everyone always has a little bit of a hard time pronouncing my name but don't be scared. It's
              Ta-Ri-Ta Yes !!! I think you got it right or you can just call me "GIFT" that's been my nickname since I was
              born(everyone in Thailand is given a nickname ). I'm originally from Thailand the land of smiles. The best country for
              an awesome vacation with Crystal Clear Beaches and delicious food.
              </p>
              <p>
              I am a full stack developer with various skills learned throughout working in diverse fields before learning how to
              code. The technical skills I have learned include JavaScript, Python, React, jQuery, Node, Express, Django, HTML, CSS,
              and Bootstrap. I have utilized all the technologies learned to build projects plus web applications in which you can
              explore in my "Projects" section.
              </p>
              <p>
              About 10 years ago I was a journalist/reporter in Thailand and I wanted to work on international news but there was a
              requirement that I needed to further improve my English language. I decided to come to America to improve my English
              skills. I came here 10 years ago with no knowledge of the English language (maybe like 20 words). I went to an English
              school in NYC for 4 months then I began to communicate with people and got a job as a bartender. I switched my job to
              work as a shopper/delivery driver with Instacart. After that I was able to acquire a job as a Thai instructor to teach
              students as a group and individuals that would like to learn the Thai language depending on their purpose be it
              business, traveling, personal, etc... . A year later I switched to another job as an Ads Evaluator Rater with zero chaos
              a company that works alongside both youtube and google. Finally, I became a Correction Officer at Rikers Island.
              </p>
              <p>
              Then slowly started to see myself as a Software Developer for the sole reason that I love to learn new things and
              explore new stuff. I never stopped learning. I learned another language in a short time. when I was working with
              Instacart I always wondered how to make a similar application and later I became a language instructor to teach others
              knowledge of my native language showing that I love to share my knowledge with others. I worked as a correction officer
              where they taught me how to implement interpersonal communication skills. I work well under pressure and have great
              communication and leadership qualities. Whenever I do have free time I love to relax and listen to jazz, hiking,
              traveling, playing video games, and my favorite is cooking. I recently started to learn how to play the kalimba along
              with coding as a hobby.
